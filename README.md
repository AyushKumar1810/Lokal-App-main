## ‚ùå Common Errors & Fixes

1. **fbjs/lib/invariant could not be found**
   - Run: `npm install fbjs`
   - If the issue persists, delete `node_modules` and reinstall:
     ```sh
     rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
     npm install
     ```

2. **EAS permissions issue**
   - Ensure you're logged into the correct account:

eas whoami
     ```
   - If needed, log in again:

3. **Expo Build Issues**
